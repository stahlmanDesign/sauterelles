Sauterelles is a HTML5 game made in the context of the student protests in Montreal in 2012 and 2015. It requires adding the impact/ and weltmeister/ folders to src/lib/. These folders are available when you purchase ImpactJS. It also uses the impact-node server instead of Impact's built-in PHP solution for the Weltmeister editor and for baking.

#The game


- A guy originally meant to resemble Prime Minister Jean Charest has to do battle with the infestation of grasshoppers the student protesters unleashed in the HEC.- Version 1.0.1

#Setup

- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in http://localhost:3000. To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>
</ul>
